## Welcome to my website!

This website is where I will be accepting commissions and my past work. Feel free to contact me any time via my discord @fufubelly#0871 and on my twitter @fufubelly.
I am a map maker, and I also do gfx/renders, although I still have a lot to learn. 

whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Past work
Here I will be providing my past work for influence:

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PrimiDev/fufubelly.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
